## Story & Introduction

You have just reached Tellus to make contact with a pre-spacefaring species, as they seem completely oblivious to your previous attempts of communication. Unfortunately the methane supplies of your vessel have reached critical levels and need to be replenished to continue your mission.

Your orders are simple:
- Abduct local livestock to gain energy for signal transmission.
- Notify humans of your presence! Use energy to contact them via radio towers.
- Take great care not to hit anything during your mission!
